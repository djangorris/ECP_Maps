# ECP_Maps
### Visualizing Essential Community Provider (ECP) data in Colorado.
Initially using data from SERFF, but there may be better data elsewhere. 

Total counts are not as helpful for an ECP analysis. Network adequacy issues 
arise when a plan covers a small percentage of a specific specialty. Even if
they have a high count in other areas.

To calculate a percentage of ECPs that a QHP has contracted with, the plan 
ECP total will need to be compared against the total ECPs in an area.
CMS provides a list of all ECPs here:
